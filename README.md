# My First Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my first data analysis portfolio project! 🚀

## About This Project
This is a simple sales data analysis project where I:
- Cleaned and explored a sample dataset
- Used Python and Pandas for data manipulation
- Created visualizations to identify trends (e.g., top products and sales by region)
- Derived key business insights

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Future Improvements
- Add more datasets
- Build interactive dashboards with Streamlit or Tableau

Thanks for visiting! More projects coming soon. 😊
